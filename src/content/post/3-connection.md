Grande Experiences, creators and producers of the most visited multi-sensory exhibition in the world, Van Gogh Alive, developed **Connection** to celebrate the spirit of Indigenous Australia.

Connection brings to life the stories, art and culture of Australia’s First Peoples through multi-sensory projections and dynamic immersion.

Cutting-edge visual, audio and aroma technologies transform original artworks from First Nations artists – including Emily Kame Kngwarreye, Albert Namatjira, Tommy Watson, Gabriella Possum Nungurrayi, Anna Pitjara and Lin Onus – into a powerfully rich and interactive celebration of Country, culture and community.

The artistic line-up showcases work from emerging and established artists, mainly from remote regions. It features a magnificent soundtrack by Indigenous musicians including William Barton, Yothu Yindi, Dr G Yunupingu, Emily Wurramara and Archie Roach.
