[SoupStone 汤食](https://soupstone.business.site) is a Cantonese restaurant located near ANU in Canberra. We discovered the owner is actually from Malaysia. The food here is surprisingly good and tasty.

Afterwards we walked around the district of Acton and stepped into a beautifully decorated [85&deg;C Cafe](https://www.85cafe.com.au) with a flower wall. Here we posed for photos as well as bought some buns and sweets for tomorrow's breakfast.
