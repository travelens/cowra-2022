Following 2 years of cancellations due to the pandemic, Sakura Matsuri (Cherry Blossom Festival) wil be returning to the Cowra Japanese Garden and Cultural Centre in 2022! To mark the occasion, we visited the garden wearing kimonos and hauris.

## Cowra Japanese Garden & Cultural Centre

The Cowra Japanese Garden & Cultural Centre is a tangible monument to peace and reconciliation between two countries. The principal object and purpose of the Cowra Japanese Garden and Cultural Centre is the promotion of Japanese design including; landscape, garden and built form design, Japanese crafts, Japanese movable cultural heritage and to support and advance the cultural relations between the people of the Cowra Shire in New South Wales and the people of Japan.

Ken Nakajima, created the Kaiyushiki (strolling) garden, to symbolise the Japanese landscape. The rocky hillside, manicured hedges, waterfalls, streams and the two lakes provide a serene and secure environment for a myriad of local birdlife. Special features of the Garden include a traditional Edo Cottage, an authentic open-air Tea house and a Bonsai House. The Cultural Centre adjoins the main building, with the first gallery showcasing exhibitions from a variety of local and regional artists. The next two galleries feature an extensive collection of beautiful Japanese artworks and artefacts. An Educational & Multi-purpose Centre is available for functions ranging from seminars to theatrical performances.

The 5 hectares of garden opened in 1979. Koi carp can be seen from the viewing platforms overlooking the lakes.

## Sakura Matsuri

Sakura Matsuri is the highlight of the year at the Cowra Japanese Garden, a huge festival celebrating the coming of spring, the beauty of the seasonal cherry blossoms, and Japanese culture itself.

Visitors have the chance to experience traditional Japanese culture and performance in this day of joyful celebration.

The festival shows off the best of Japanese culture with displays and demonstrations including music, dance, martial arts and sumo, arts and crafts, tea ceremonies and more. The Taiko Drummers are always particularly popular, with heart-thumping rhythms reverberating through the garden. There is also the market, with stall holders offering a range of Japanese food, drinks and products.

Sakura Matsuri is celebrated annually in September when the cherry blossoms are at their peak. The blossoms are usually in flower from late mid September until mid October, depending on weather each year. The Garden also includes apricot, apple and plum blossoms along with magnolia.
