The Cowra Bridge Pylons are situated beneath the Lachlan River Bridge and feature Aboriginal murals. The murals were painted by local Aboriginal artist, Kym Freeman and depict the history of the Wiradjuri people who inhabited the Cowra area before English settlement. The size of the murals and the attention to fine detail make them a must-see when visiting Cowra. They are just a short walk from the Visitor Information Centre down towards the river.
