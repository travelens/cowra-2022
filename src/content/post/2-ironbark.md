This place seemed promising, serving a variety of American inspired meals using a smoked barbeque. They have a hand written menu on the chalkboard. However, we were probably a bit disappointed by the serving size and also the taste. It wasn't bad, but it was ordinary and we were expecting greatness.

The building itself is an old mill that looks quite rustic but the decor was a bit plain.
