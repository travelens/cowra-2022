Final stop on the trip is a visit to beautiful [Tulip Top Gardens](https://www.tuliptopgardens.com.au/).

This place is a popular attraction, particularly for Asian tourists, during springtime. It features acres of stunning garden beds framed by weeping willows, and thouands of blossoms. Every year, almost a million tulips, daffodils and other flowers creatively planted providing a stunning and colourful vista for all garden lovers.

The garden was in full bloom and itâ€™s such a joy to visit this after a 2 year hiatus due to COVID-19 lockdowns! Took so many photos, every corner and turn of the eye yielded an amazing view. The place was already packed when we arrived and this is without the usual busloads of Chinese tourists.
