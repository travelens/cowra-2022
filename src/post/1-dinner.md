We had dinner at the Imperial Hotel Cowra - wow the serving sizes here are gigantic. I could barely finish half my steak and couldnâ€™t have any of the chips. Each meal could easily be shared by 2 people. It was delicious. Afterwards we tried to paint the town pink by walking down main street. Two publicans came out to chat with us - I think they were intrigued to see a group of Asian ladies.
