[Ms Ba Co](https://www.msbaco.com) means “three girls” – a name that represent the three daughters of the owner. We had a selection of Vietnamese dishes here - I had the roast pork banh mi which I've always liked.

Afterwards, some of us went shopping at [Canberra Centre](https://canberracentre.qicre.com/) and we ended up having afternoon tea at [Via Dolce](https://www.viadolce.com.au/).
